# Introduction
We propose a novel method that fuses polarization information with ill-posed physical models, incorporating ambiguous surface normals and a specular confidence mechanism specifically designed for highly reflective regions. To efficiently fuse these features in complex scenes, we design a novel dual-branch deep fusion network, which introduces a coarse-to-fine hybrid fusion scheme based on Content-Guided Attention (CGA) and a Transformer Encoder module for global feature extraction.
Extensive experiments conducted under challenging conditions-including multi-illumination, low-texture, and strong specular reflections-demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SfP approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The proposed technique exhibits broad application potential, particularly in smart manufacturing, surface defect inspection, and medical imaging.
